# Given two strings that include only lowercase alpha characters, str_1 and str_2, write a function that returns a new sorted string that contains any character (only once) that appeared in str_1 or str_2.

# Examples:

# csLongestPossible("aabbbcccdef", "xxyyzzz") -> "abcdefxyz"
# csLongestPossible("abc", "abc") -> "abc"
# [execution time limit] 4 seconds (py3)

# [input] string str_1

# [input] string str_2

# [output] string
