# Given a start integer and an ending integer (both inclusive), write a function that returns the count (not the sum) of all integers in the range (except integers that contain the digit 5).

# Examples:

# csAnythingButFive(1, 5) -> 1, 2, 3, 4, -> 4 (there are 4 integers in the range that do not contain the digit 5)
# csAnythingButFive(1, 9) -> 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 -> 8
# csAnythingButFive(4, 17) -> 4,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,16,17 -> 12
# Notes:

# The output can contain the digit 5.
# The start number will always be less than the end number (both numbers can also be negative).
# [execution time limit] 4 seconds (py3)

# [input] integer start

# [input] integer end

# [output] integer
